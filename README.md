+ Mainly inverse CDF Method pseudo code:  
CDF $`F(x)`$    
    - Sample *n* from uniform(0, 1), each of them is labeled $`u_i`$
    - Find the inverse function????????? of PDF $`F^{-1}`$
        * $`y = F(x) \rightarrow x = f^{-1}(y)`$
    - $`x = F^{-1}(u)`$ is sampled x
        * Note the domain of u (Inverse), make sure $`u \in (0,1)`$ falls in the range
    - plot histogram which corresponds to the frequency of x in certain bin.
