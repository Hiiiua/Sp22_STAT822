+ Mainly inverse CDF Method pseudo code: CDF $F(x)$
    - Sample *n* from uniform(0, 1), each of them is labeled $u_i$
    - Find the inverse function????????? of PDF $F^{-1}$
        * $y = F(x) \rightarrow x = f^{-1}(y)$
    - $x = F^{-1}(u)$ is sampled x
        * Note the domain of u (Inverse), make sure $u \in (0,1)$ falls in the range
    - plot histogram which corresponds to the frequency of x in certain bin.
